This is an incomplete list of what we're considering for Model 01 design changes, as well as the current status of those changes.

# Mechanical

## Enclosure 

- [ ] Reshape butterfly to better match keycaps
- [ ] Rethink edge thicknesses for structural integrity
- [ ] Rethink screw-head cutouts (they likely caused drop test #1 failure
- [ ] consider how little of the underside we can cut out 
- [ ] rethink angle & placement of interconnect jacks
- [ ] resculpt key cutout to match new keycap outline

## Keycap shapes

- [ ] test out convex thumb keys (may help with chording thumb keys if designed correctly)
- [ ] increase key draft angles to reduce mis-presses
- [ ] consider increasing zxcvbm,./- row angle to remove 'cliff' when pulling back fingers to hit them
- [ ] soften swoop on 1q0p keys 

## Interconnect

- [ ] spec new interconnect bar
- [ ] price new interconnect design
- [ ] consider material/finish for interconnect bar to minimize clattering when dropped

## Feet

- [ ] specify new feet design
- [ ] design new feet

# Electronics

## Components

- [ ] qualify new issi io expanders
- [ ] qualify new apa102c LEDs
- [ ] find better interconnect jacks
- [ ] investigate USB-C connectors
- [ ] investigate MicroUSB connectors with through-hole electrical traces

## Schematic

- [ ] integrate design changes

## PCB

- [ ] consider reprecussions of pcb side choices for various components
- [ ] test out new LED placement scheme
- [ ] test out LED location options
- [ ] think through pcb geometry
- [ ] design pcb-to-plate spacing and mounting

# Aesthetic

- [ ] consider butterfly shape

# Software

 - [] Rewrite from scratch. (Existing firmware was all proof of concept)
 
 
# Key layout 
- [ ] Lengthen escape/butterfly to make them easier to hit with the thumbs and to remove wooden finger
- [ ] tighten thumb arc
- [ ] Slide palm key further out
- [ ] make palm key outline reversible
- [ ] consider moving 5tgb and 6yhn down 1/4 key to account for finger reach
- [ ] consider moving pinkie keys up 1/4 key to decrease learning curve. 
- [ ] consider moving tab/return down a hair to make them easier to reach
